Assignment:

Without succumbing to the temptation of an Internet search,
 explain as clearly as possible,
 in a plaintext file,
 how you know whether each case is solvable -- and if so, how many solutions it has.

Note:
1) "solvable" means that there is a configuration of the chess board with the same number of queens as size of board. (ie. 2 for 2x2)
2) Queen moves any number of steps forward, backwards, and diagonal. Thus, two queens cannot occupy the same row and column (+diagonal).

2x2
Verdict: Not solvable. (Maximum=1 queen)
Reasoning/Proof: Once one queen is placed, there are no spots available to place a second one.

3x3
Verdict: Not solvable. (Maximum=2 queens)
Reasoning/Proof: I have identified three different ways of placement for the first queen to test all the possible configurations:

key: - (available for placement of another queen)
     ~ (not available for placement)
     x (queen)

a) placing in the middle 
   ~~~
   ~x~
   ~~~
b) placing at a corner
   ~-~	   ~x~
   ~~- --> ~~~ 
   x~~ 	   x~~
c) and placing in between two corners
   -~-	   x~~
   ~~~ --> ~~~ 
   ~x~ 	   ~x~

These tests yielded a maximum of two queens placed and since other configurations are similar in type to the ones listed above, I think 3x3 is unsolvable.Similar testing was employed for all the other board sizes.

4x4
Verdict: Solvable (# of solutions= 8)
Reasoning/Proof: Starting a queen off on a corner resulted in a maximum of 3 placed, as well as on a center square.Placing a queen on any one of the spots on the outer edge between the two corners resulted in a solved board. This configuration featured a lot of overlap between two placed queens and allowed for placement. There are a total of 8 squares of this "type".
eg.
	~~x~
	x~~~
	~~~x
	~x~~


5x5
Verdict: Solvable (# of solutions=21)
Reasoning/Proof: Tested center positions outer rim, corners outer rim.  corners of inner rim (didnt work). center= worked, inner rim middle: worked
6x6
7x7
8x8
