Assignment:

Without succumbing to the temptation of an Internet search,
 explain as clearly as possible,
 in a plaintext file,
 how you know whether each case is solvable -- and if so, how many solutions it has.

Note:
1) "solvable" means that there is a configuration of the chess board with the same number of queens as size of board. (ie. 2 for 2x2)
2) Queen moves any number of steps forward, backwards, and diagonal. Thus, two queens cannot occupy the same row and column (+diagonal).

2x2
Verdict: Not solvable. (Maximum=1 queen)
Reasoning/Proof: Once one queen is placed, there are no spots available to place a second one.

3x3
Verdict: Not solvable. (Maximum=2 queens)
Reasoning/Proof: I have identified three different ways of placement for the first queen to test all the possible configurations:
key: - (available for placement of another queen)
a) placing in the middle
