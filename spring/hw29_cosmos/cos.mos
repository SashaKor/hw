The Immortals

This was my favorite episode watched thus far. I really loved how the episode tied together the human search for immortality and the development of writing, as well as the genetic code that records the instructions for each living creature on Earth. It was especially mind-blowing to learn of the seeding hypothesis for the origins of life on Earth and, potentially, on other planets. I used to be se in my belief that life formed in shallow pools of warm water near the Earth’s surface; this episode seriously shook up this conviction. The question I have remaining is that, if the spread of life through seeding make life ubiquitous rather than rare, why haven’t we discovered life forms on other planets? I know that this is a question that is not easily answered as we are limited by the extent of our own technology. Also cool was the prediction for the future proposed by Tyson towards the end of the episode. I am an optimist who really believes that it is within the human capacity to right our wrongs and become a society of global citizens, united by our shared heritage of being inhabitants of the Earth.
