	Q0: What do you make of the multiple class definitions in a single .java file?
	I was surprised to see both class Demo and Boardasaurus defined in a single .java file. Neither of the class definitions feature the key word public, so that may be why several classes can be found. The code compiles, so this is a valid thing to do.  What is the purpose of a separate class for the driver method as opposed to the board setup/moves? Does the reason have to do with easier manipulation of code? 

	Q1: How are the command line arguments processed?
	Command line arguments are processed using try and catch exceptions. Command line arguments are used to set the size of the board, and to set a default size if none provided. They are also used to set the delay time of the board. The code accesses a specific value from the command line using args[0] or args[1]. Helper method delay also helps with try/catch. Thread.sleep() delays execution by given n ms.

	Q2: What happens if no command line arguments are given?
	If no arguments are given, default values are used to prevent crashing. Board size is set to 8 and timeDelay is given to be 500.
	
        Q3: What is the nature/purpose of the recursion? Is it necessary for the animation?
        Q4: What do you expect to see when you run it?
        Q5: How long do you expect it to run?
        Q6: What does ANSI stand for? (You are permitted some intertubes searching hereâ€¦). What is it good for?
